    <h1>Multi User Test Runner</h1>
    <p>
        Multi User Test Runner is a custom JUnit (4.12 or newer) test runner for testing
        authorization with multiple different users. The library requires only minimal
        configuration to be able run tests with many different users and roles. It is
        easy to verify that your system denies and permits the access for correct users
        even in more complex scenarios where the authorization depends on multiple users
        and their roles.

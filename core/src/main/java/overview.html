    <h1>Multi User Test Runner</h1>
    <p>
        Multi User Test Runner is a custom JUnit (4.12 or newer) test runner for testing
        authorization with multiple different users. The library requires only minimal
        configuration to be able run tests with many different users and roles. It is
        easy to verify that your system denies and permits the access for correct users
        even in more complex scenarios where the authorization depends on multiple users
        and their roles.
    </p>

    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>
        Configure the base test class:
        <ol>
            <li>Create a configured abstract class by extending {@link fi.vincit.multiusertest.test.AbstractUserRoleIT} class and implement methods. This will be your base class for your test class.</li>
            <li>Configure runner and default expected annotation with {@link fi.vincit.multiusertest.annotation.MultiUserTestConfig}</li>
            <li>Create a test class which is extended from your configured class.</li>
            <li>Add {@link fi.vincit.multiusertest.annotation.TestUsers} annotation for your test class</li>
        </ol>
        Write the tests:
        <ol>
            <li>Write test methods</li>
            <li>Add e.g. <i>authentication().expect(toFail(ifAnyOf("user:user")));</i> before method to test to mark which roles/users are expected to fail</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
